     be far away. Try the cellars and the garden. It should not take long
     to dig up the likely places. This house is older than the
     water-pipes. There must be a disused well somewhere. Try your luck
     there."

     "But how did you know of it, and how was it done?"

     "I'll show you first how it was done, and then I will give the
     explanation which is due to you, and even more to my long-suffering
     friend here, who has been invaluable throughout. But, first, I would
     give you an insight into this man's mentality. It is a very unusual
     one--so much so that I think his destination is more likely to be
     Broadmoor than the scaffold. He has, to a high degree, the sort of
     mind which one associates with the mediaeval Italian nature rather
     than with the modern Briton. He was a miserable miser who made his
     wife so wretched by his niggardly ways that she was a ready prey for
     any adventurer. Such a one came upon the scene in the person of this
     chess-playing doctor. Amberley excelled at chess--one mark, Watson,
     of a scheming mind. Like all misers, he was a jealous man, and his
     jealousy became a frantic mania. Rightly or wrongly, he suspected an
     intrigue. He determined to have his revenge, and he planned it with
     diabolical cleverness. Come here!"

     Holmes led us along the passage with as much certainty as if he had
     lived in the house and halted at the open door of the strong-room.

     "Pooh! What an awful smell of paint!" cried the inspector.

     "That was our first clue," said Holmes. "You can thank Dr. Watson's
     observation for that, though he failed to draw the inference. It set
     my foot upon the trail. Why should this man at such a time be filling
     his house with strong odours? Obviously, to cover some other smell
     which he wished to conceal--some guilty smell which would suggest
     suspicions. Then came the idea of a room such as you see here with
     iron door and shutter--a hermetically sealed room. Put those two
     facts together, and whither do they lead? I could only determine that
     by examining the house myself. I was already certain that the case
     was serious, for I had examined the box-office chart at the Haymarket
     Theatre--another of Dr. Watson's bull's-eyes--and ascertained that
     neither B thirty nor thirty-two of the upper circle had been occupied
     that night. Therefore, Amberley had not been to the theatre, and his
     alibi fell to the ground. He made a bad slip when he allowed my
     astute friend to notice the number of the seat taken for his wife.
     The question now arose how I might be able to examine the house. I
     sent an agent to the most impossible village I could think of, and
     summoned my man to it at such an hour that he could not possibly get
     back. To prevent any miscarriage, Dr. Watson accompanied him. The
     good vicar's name I took, of course, out of my Crockford. Do I make
     it all clear to you?"

     "It is masterly," said the inspector in an awed voice.

     "There being no fear of interruption I proceeded to burgle the house.
     Burglary has always been an alternative profession had I cared to
     adopt it, and I have little doubt that I should have come to the
     front. Observe what I found. You see the gas-pipe along the skirting
     here. Very good. It rises in the angle of the wall, and there is a
     tap here in the corner. The pipe runs out into the strong-room, as
     you can see, and ends in that plaster rose in the centre of the
     ceiling, where it is concealed by the ornamentation. That end is wide
     open. At any moment by turning the outside tap the room could be
     flooded with gas. With door and shutter closed and the tap full on I
     would not give two minutes of conscious sensation to anyone shut up
     in that little chamber. By what devilish device he decoyed them there
     I do not know, but once inside the door they were at his mercy."

     The inspector examined the pipe with interest. "One of our officers
     mentioned the smell of gas," said he, "but of course the window and
     door were open then, and the paint--or some of it--was already about.
     He had begun the work of painting the day before, according to his
     story. But what next, Mr. Holmes?"

     "Well, then came an incident which was rather unexpected to myself. I
     was slipping through the pantry window in the early dawn when I felt
     a hand inside my collar, and a voice said: 'Now, you rascal, what are
     you doing in there?' When I could twist my head round I looked into
     the tinted spectacles of my friend and rival, Mr. Barker. It was a
     curious foregathering and set us both smiling. It seems that he had
     been engaged by Dr. Ray Ernest's family to make some investigations
     and had come to the same conclusion as to foul play. He had watched
     the house for some days and had spotted Dr. Watson as one of the
     obviously suspicious characters who had called there. He could hardly
     arrest Watson, but when he saw a man actually climbing out of the
     pantry window there came a limit to his restraint. Of course, I told
     him how matters stood and we continued the case together."
